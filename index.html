        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm a Brazilian who loves to travel. I've studied philosophy what made me hungry for learning new things. I've lived in Spain, Portugal, Argentina, East Timor, Australia and now I'm living in South Korea.</p>
        <p>I work helping small businesses to implement online marketing strategies. I like to launch digital products, create and optimise Sales Funnels. Also, I develop Email Marketing Campaigns, Paid Traffic Campaigns (Google, Facebook, Instagram, etc.).</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My primary goal of learning programming is to have fun. Like in philosophy, a developer needs to structure his idea very logically. Once I learn how to code, I want to teach kids how to become a programmer. To do this, I need to learn:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>Game Development</li>

          <h3>Day 01</h3>
          <img src="images/diary01.jpg" alt="Introduction to HTML and CSS course thumbnail">
          <p>Today I decided to signup for the Front End Web Development Treehouse Techdegree. I watched a course called Introduction to HTML and CSS by Treasure Porth. The course is an excellent start to give us a foundation about the structure of the web pages.</p>
          <p>I've learned that we use HTML - HyperText Markup Language - to structure the content of our pages. Also, I learned that we use CSS - Cascading Style Sheets - to give instructions to the browser about how to show our content, making our pages beautiful and attractive to the visitors.</p>
          <p>After every topic of the course, we have a questionnaire about what we've studied and a coding test that makes us seating the hands on the keyboard and indeed code a few lines.</p>
          <p>I'm very excited about what is coming next!</p>

          <h3>Day 02</h3>
          <img src="images/diary02.jpg" alt="HTML Basics course thumbnail">
          <p>Today I finished the second course in Unit 1, HTML Basics. I watched the videos, did all the tests and coding challenges. The teacher is Guil Hernandez.</p>
          <p>I've learned a lot about semantic HTML, that add meaning for the sections in our pages. In semantic HTML, we use self-explained tags like:</p>
          <pre>
            &lt;header&gt;Container for introductory content and/or navigation menu&lt;&sol;header&gt;
            &lt;section&gt;Creates a new section in your page&lt;&sol;section&gt;
            &lt;main&gt;Represents the fundamental content of your page&lt;&sol;main&gt;
            &lt;footer&gt;Container for aditional information such as Copyright, Contact, Aditional Navigation, Authorship, etc.&lt;&sol;footer&gt;
          </pre>
          <p>As you can see, Semantic HTML is self-explained and makes the code understandable for humans, search engines and browsers.</p>

          <h3>Day 03</h3>
          <img src="images/diary03.jpg" alt="Photo of my laptop with the Project 01 page opened">
          <p>G'day! Today was a fascinating day. I learned about GitHub, an exciting community where people learn, share and coding together.</p>
          <p>Also, I started my first Front End Web Development Techdegree project. In this project, I will practice all the HTML and CSS I've learned so far. I hope I can do it well.</p>
          <p>In this project, I have to create a Personal Profile Page. There is an example page that we can download and we have to change some information, add new content, etc.</p>
          <p>I will keep updating this diary, and therefore, I can have a record of my coding studies. If you want to check my updates, visit my <a href="diary.html"><strong>Diary.</strong></a></p>
