            <h3>Day 01</h3>
            <img src="images/diary01.jpg" alt="Introduction to HTML and CSS course thumbnail">
            <p>Today I decided to signup for the Front End Web Development Treehouse Techdegree. I watched a course called Introduction to HTML and CSS by Treasure Porth. The course is an excellent start to give us a foundation about the structure of the web pages.</p>
            <p>I've learned that we use HTML - HyperText Markup Language - to structure the content of our pages. Also, I learned that we use CSS - Cascading Style Sheets - to give instructions to the browser about how to show our content, making our pages beautiful and attractive to the visitors.</p>
            <p>After every topic of the course, we have a questionnaire about what we've studied and a coding test that makes us seating the hands on the keyboard and indeed code a few lines.</p>
            <p>I'm very excited about what is coming next!</p>

            <h3>Day 02</h3>
            <img src="images/diary02.jpg" alt="HTML Basics course thumbnail">
            <p>Today I finished the second course in Unit 1, HTML Basics. I watched the videos, did all the tests and coding challenges. The teacher is Guil Hernandez.</p>
            <p>I've learned a lot about semantic HTML, that add meaning for the sections in our pages. In semantic HTML, we use self-explained tags like:</p>
            <pre>
              &lt;header&gt;Container for introductory content and/or navigation menu&lt;&sol;header&gt;
              &lt;section&gt;Creates a new section in your page&lt;&sol;section&gt;
              &lt;main&gt;Represents the fundamental content of your page&lt;&sol;main&gt;
              &lt;footer&gt;Container for aditional information such as Copyright, Contact, Aditional Navigation, Authorship, etc.&lt;&sol;footer&gt;
            </pre>
            <p>As you can see, Semantic HTML is self-explained and makes the code understandable for humans, search engines and browsers.</p>

            <h3>Day 03</h3>
            <img src="images/diary03.jpg" alt="Photo of my laptop with the Project 01 page opened">
            <p>G'day! Today was a fascinating day. I learned about GitHub, an exciting community where people learn, share and coding together.</p>
            <p>Also, I started my first Front End Web Development Techdegree project. In this project, I will practice all the HTML and CSS I've learned so far. I hope I can do it well.</p>
            <p>In this project, I have to create a Personal Profile Page. There is an example page that we can download and we have to change some information, add new content, etc.</p>
            <p>I will keep updating this diary, and therefore, I can have a record of my coding studies.</p>

            <h3>Day 05</h3>
            <img src="images/diary05.jpg" alt="Photo of my laptop showing the code for the background image on the Header Section">
            <p>Hey hey! I'm working on the Unit 01 Project. As you already know, it's a Personal Profile Page. I created a new section on the Index Page. In this new Section, I posted the last entry of my Coding Diary. There is also a link to the Diary page I've created with all my notes.</p>
            <p>I had a few problems with CSS to make the page look good, so I needed to do some research. The <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" target="_blank">W3Schools Page</a> is an incredible source.</p>
            <p>I changed the background image on the Header. It's a photo of Jeju Island (where I live) from an aeroplane. But the position of the picture wasn't showing the plane's wing, so I had to make a change in the CSS file. Thanks <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" target="_blank">W3Schools!</a></p>

            <h3>Day 10</h3>
            <img src="images/diary10.jpg" alt="Image of W3C Validation Service saying: I Love Validator">
            <p>G'day! Today I created the Experience Page, changed the links to my Social Media Profiles and validate the HTML and CSS codes, no errors found.</p>
            <p>I finished this project! Cheers!!!!</p>
            <p>Now I'm going to upload it to my GitHub Depository and ask the people on the Slack group to give me some feedback before I submit the project for review.</p>
            <p>I can't wait for Unit 02 and keep learning. I'll write more about my studies in a few days. Thanks all!</p>
